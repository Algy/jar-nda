The JVM uses a compact way of storing method signatures, of which constructors are considered a special case.

For your example:

() indicates a method taking no arguments
V indicates that it returns nothing
The other parts of the scheme are:

B - byte
C - char
D - double
F - float
I - int
J - long
S - short
V - void
Z - boolean
[ - array of the thing following the bracket
L [class name] ; - instance of this class, with dots becoming slashes
( [args] ) [return type] - method signature
For example:

public int foo(String bar, long[][] baz)
would become

(Ljava/lang/String;[[J)I
